Create an AppImage for SMath Studio https://smath.com

This is made to run on Github Actions but it is also possible to run locally for debug purposes. To run locally run the following.

`sudo apt install libmono-system-windows-forms4.0-cil`

`./build_appimage.sh`

Output is in the "out" directory.
